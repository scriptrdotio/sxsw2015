#About this repository

This repository contains sample applications that demonstrate how to use scriptr.io to implement full-fledged IoT applications. The sample applications described hereafter also leverage Kinoma Create devices and wot.io, a Data Exchange platform on the Cloud.

Available applications:

* sound_level_management
* ScriptrdotioNotifications

**Note that these applications have a front-end part (deployed on a Kinoma Create device) and a back-end part (deployed on scriptr.io)**

Check the kinoma sub-folder for more information.
